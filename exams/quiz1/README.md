1. My answer: The three types of version control system  are 1. local: is database located on your local computer and every file change is stored as a patch, every patch contains only the changes made to the file since the last version. 2 centralized: is a single server containing all file versions, which enables people to simultaneously access files on their server, a way this solves a local version control system problem is because here, everyone knows what what everyone else on the project is doing and allows for easy collaboration between people.  3. distributed: is where people can not only look at a snapshot of the files, but can look at the repository, this solves one of the distributed version control systems problem because now any of a persons repositories can send a copy of the project version to someone else.
