a = 2                 The 1 in front of the a messes up the variable a since we are having a equal something else
a1 = b                This works because there is nothing in front of the a instead its after the a
x = 2  
y = x + 4 # is it 6?  The X does not work, must be x in order to having the function running
from math import tan  Math does not work only math 
print (tan(pi))       Must have () around tan and pi since you are printing that statement and also ""
pi = '3.14159â€™        Cannot use " and then ', you must use one only
print (tan('pi'))     Must include the '' because pi is not a string
c = 4**3**2**3
_ = ((c-78564)/c + 32)  Not add an extra () in the end
discount = 12         % is not used the same in jupyter notebook
AMOUNT = 120.-1       Cannot leave it blank after the -
amount = 120          $ is not used the same on jupyter notebook
address = "hpl@simula.no"   Must add "" around what the address is
a = "duck"            and is a command on jupyter notebook, therefore it cannot be used as a variable, change it to a
class = 'INF1100, gr 2"   Cannot use ' and then use ", must be only one
x=1, continue_ = x > 0     Must have a variable for x must, for example x=1, now the code will work
rev = fox = True
Persian = ['a human language']
true = fox is rev in Persian
